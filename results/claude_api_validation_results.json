    "code": "Here's a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The function `factorial` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.\n\n2. The base case of the recursion is when `n` is equal to 0. In this case, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.\n\n3. For any other positive integer `n`, the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` as the argument and multiplies the result by `n`.\n\n4. The recursive calls continue until `n` reaches 0, at which point the base case is triggered, and the recursion starts to unwind.\n\n5. The final result is the product of all the numbers from 1 to `n`, which represents the factorial of `n`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `factorial` function:\n\n```python\nprint(factorial(0))  # Output: 1\nprint(factorial(1))  # Output: 1\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(factorial(10))  # Output: 3628800\n```\n\nIn the above examples:\n- `factorial(0)` returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1.\n- `factorial(1)` returns 1 because the factorial of 1 is 1.\n- `factorial(5)` recursively calculates 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120.\n- `factorial(10)` recursively calculates 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 3,628,800.\n\nNote that the factorial function grows very quickly, and for large values of `n`, it can exceed the maximum recursive depth allowed by Python or even cause integer overflow. Therefore, it's important to use this function with appropriate input values."
